      "{'review': ' I bought mine 4/17 with 98K. Have been wanting a V6 5-sp, \\'05-\\'09 vintage for years. The engine is fine. Sounds good. Great mileage. Good power. I pride myself on smooth take-off and gear changes, but this is the orneriest transmission I\\'ve ever used! The difference between idle and 4000 rpm is about 1/8\" on the gas pedal, so starting-out without either stalling or way over-revving takes a LOT of finesse. Gear changes are very difficult to master smoothly without lurching. The ride is very harsh with a lot of road noise, which I suppose goes with a quasi high-performance car. My \\'01 S-10 is quieter and smoother. All that said, it\\'s a smokin\\' hot looking car, and still fun to drive. This was the first-off of the modern \\'Stangs.

After Ford looked at the car they quoted me $4,100 to fix what they called a cam phaser issue (pumps oil to the top end of the motor). Needless to say I pulled the car from Ford and took to a performance shop, who said it needed a new motor for $4,800. Well thats great but this is not my toy its my daily driver.

Its faster, better looking, and really just more of a car than any used BMW/mercedes within its pricing segment.
